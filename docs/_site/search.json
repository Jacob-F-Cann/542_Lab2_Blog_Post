As part of a push for renewable energy solutions to combat climate change and the demand for better wearable and or implantable medical technologies, battery technology has accelerated in growth in recent years. Electric cars are more prevalent than ever, energy storage for renewable solar and wind energy is growing faster than ever and portable battery powered devices are sold by countless companies.

To make one of the major issues apparent in these technologies consider the example of a pacemaker and an electric car. If someone relied on a permanent pacemaker for their heart to function properly and safely, would you not like to know when the battery in the pacemaker is likely to begin functioning at a lower capacity after each charge and be in a more volatile state? You could replace the battery early to be cautious, but keep in mind that requires surgery and is expensive, you would therefore not want to replace. Furthermore, if you owned an electric vehicle for several years, would you not like to know when your car’s range is not what it used to be and what it has decreased to now on a full charge? Electric car owners or prospective owners already have range anxiety with brand new electric cars, let alone ones with degraded batteries?\nThese examples point to a major issue with battery technologies, which is the decrease in charge capacity overtime due to use. Predicting in a quantitative way when this degradation will occur and by how much, turns out to be an extremely difficult problem with many variables influencing the so-called battery capacity lifetime (or commonly just referred to as battery lifetime). It turns out that with enough voltage, temperature and current data of a battery charging and discharging (simulated battery use in a laboratory), these predictions become tractable with physics modelling and machine learning. The state of the art of battery lifetime prediction models, almost always involves machine learning today. The models applied in this domain are time series in nature, and therefore the examples in the training and test data are causally linked through time dependence unlike models of other regression or classification applications. This comes with its own assumptions and challenges, however the battery lifetime prediction has become increasingly accurate and reliable consequently. The major problem in the field currently is the scarcity of high-quality data for training the models. This is due to proprietary company data not being widely available and the cost of collecting the data as it requires intensive labor, capital and physical space to execute testing, in comparison with data collection for other applications. If the scarcity of data problem can be solved in the future, we will without a doubt see advances in machine learning for battery lifetime prediction."
